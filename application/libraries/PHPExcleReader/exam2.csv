2012-012,Packaging of Fiber-optic Component for Invasive Diagnosis,Filing Contingent on Licensee/Optionee,"The assembly procedure has been described in the invention disclosure with great detail. Broadly, the process involves a>etching of the fiber; b>thin film coating; c> coil enforced Kapton® (polyamide thin) tubing; and d>bonding using adhesive.    The whole structure has a biocompatible cover. The mechanical properties of different sections of the packaged device vary for steerable tip, flexible core and stiff extension. The final outer OD is around 0.014? which is close to commercial guide wire for smaller vessel use.",07/09/2011,University of Massachusetts Lowell,Xingwei Wang,xingwei_wang@uml.edu,China,,,,
2014-007, Omni-directional fiber optic ultrasound transducer  ,On Hold Pending Proof of Concept,"A simple, relatively non-invasive ultrasound catheter for imaging vascular system.  The system allows one to control an ultrasound beam to sweep out volume of blood vessel.  That control is the basic advance - it depends on sequentially sending laser pulses down one of a circular array of fiber optics.  The reflection of the ultrasound pulses off the vascular walls is picked up by a receiver.  The receiver is similar to that described in case 2009-007 (optioned to Endeavor Medical, LLC).  The ultrasound pulses are produced by a method similar to case 2011-011 (also optioned to Endeavor). The advantages of the proposed system are its small size and its ability to steer the ultrasound beam by optical rather than mechanical means,",04/11/2013,University of Massachusetts Lowell,Xingwei Wang,xingwei_wang@uml.edu,China,,,,
